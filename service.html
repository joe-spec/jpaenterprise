                <p>
                    In Nigeria,the oil & gas sector has remained one of the most important sources
                    of revenue and energy generation. With the increasing demand for Nigeria’s oil
                    & gas products, it is absolutely imperative to safe guard oil & gas infrastructures
                    and pipelines from burglars, bunkers, natural threats, and terrorists. <br><br>
                    We at JPA have mastered the art and science of providing global standard
                    surveillance and security for all kinds of manufacturing and mining
                    infrastructures, as well as assessing contingencies and tackling pipeline threats.<br><br>
                    We recruit and train our security team members on a consistent basis to
                    provide high-level security for oil and gas infrastructures and pipe lines, tackle
                    common threats, and handle all kinds of emergency situations. We are certified

                    our delivery of effective, reliable, and top-notch security services and solutions.<br><br>
                    The secret to our success is largely in our ability to combine the skills of trained
                    security guards with the intelligence local residents who understand the
                    loop holes and security breaches that vandals, natural threats, and terrorists
                    could explore to wreck both mild and severe damages. With this exceptional
                    mix, we have continued to provide unmatched security solutions for our
