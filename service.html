                            In Nigeria,the oil & gas sector has remained one of the most important sources
                            of revenue and energy generation. With the increasing demand for Nigeria’s oil
                            & gas products, it is absolutely imperative to safe guard oil & gas infrastructures
                            and pipelines from burglars, bunkers, natural threats, and terrorists. <br><br>
                            We at JPA have mastered the art and science of providing global standard
                            surveillance and security for all kinds of manufacturing and mining
                            infrastructures, as well as assessing contingencies and tackling pipeline threats.<br><br>
                            We recruit and train our security team members on a consistent basis to
                            provide high-level security for oil and gas infrastructures and pipe lines, tackle
                            common threats, and handle all kinds of emergency situations. We are certified
                            by several renowned accreditation agencies and trusted by our clients due to

                            The secret to our success is largely in our ability to combine the skills of trained
                            security guards with the intelligence local residents who understand the
                            loop holes and security breaches that vandals, natural threats, and terrorists
                            could explore to wreck both mild and severe damages. With this exceptional
